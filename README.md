# Testing APIs with Postman

## Learning Goals

- Use different kinds of clients to make requests
- Compose a request with a URL, HTTP verb, headers, and body
- Test non-GET requests using Postman

## HTTP Clients

When developing a web application with Sinatra, our primary goal is to take
**HTTP requests** and return an appropriate **response**, following the idea of
**client-server** communication. So far, we've been using one particular client
to interact with our server: the browser!

It's straightforward to use the browser to make a GET request â€” all we
have to do is enter an address in the browser's URL bar, such as
`http://localhost:9292/games`, and hit enter.

However, we also have learned a little about other HTTP verbs aside from `GET`,
such as `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. Using these other HTTP verbs is a strong
convention when working with APIs in particular: they signal to developers that
the server is going to perform a specific kind of action, based on which HTTP
verb is used in the request:

- **POST** (Create): create a new resource in a database
- **GET** (Read): access/query information from a database
- **PATCH** (Update): update one specific resource in a database
- **DELETE** (Delete): delete one specific resource from a database

We've seen how to make a POST request in JavaScript using fetch:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9292/games", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "Breath of the Wild",
    platform: "Switch",
  }),
});
```

However, running a JavaScript application and writing `fetch` requests to test
out our API in development would be quite a chore.

Luckily for us, there are some excellent tools out there to make interacting
with APIs, and customizing all different parts of the request (the headers, HTTP
verb, URL, and body) easier for us!

## Using Postman as an API Client

The tool we'll be demonstrating in this lesson is [Postman][]. Postman is an API
Client tool that will help with testing and development of our API.

First, head to this page and download Postman:
[https://www.postman.com/downloads/][postman download]. Make sure to download
the app rather than use the web version. If you have any issues downloading,
make sure to check out the [Postman docs][] for help.

Once you've downloaded Postman and signed in, you should see a screen like this:

![postman welcome screen](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/testing-apis-with-postman/postman-welcome-screen.png)

To show what we can do with Postman, we're going to be using the
[JSON Placeholder API][json placeholder], a free resource where we can try out
different requests. For our first request, we'll make a simple GET request to
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`.

Click on the plus sign to open a new tab. You should see a field where you can
enter your request:

![postman request field](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/testing-apis-with-postman/postman-request-field.png)

Enter the URL in the field and click send:

![postman get request](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/testing-apis-with-postman/postman-get-request.png)

You'll see we receive a JSON object as a response!

This API also lets us make non-GET requests, so let's see how we can use Postman
for making a POST request. We'll try recreating this `fetch` request in Postman:

```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "foo",
    body: "bar",
    userId: 1,
  }),
});
```

First, update the **URL** to be `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.
Then, click the dropdown next to the URL bar, and change the **HTTP verb** from
a GET request to a POST request.

We can also use Postman to customize what **headers** are being sent. Headers
are additional metadata that we can send with requests. In the `fetch` example
above, the `Content-Type` header tells the server that we expect to receive
`application/json` in the response. To add a header, click the 'Headers' tab,
and add a new key of `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.

Finally, we'll need some way of sending a JSON formatted string in the **body**
of the request. Click the 'Body' tab in Postman, then click the dropdown and
select 'raw' to specify that we are sending a raw string of data. Then, select
JSON from the next dropdown to specify that the string will be formatted as
JSON. Now we can add a JSON formatted string to the text area below the
dropdown:

```json
{
  "title": "foo",
  "body": "bar",
  "userId": 1
}
```

> **Note**: for the string to be considered valid JSON, all the keys on the
> object must be in **double-quotes**. There also can't be any trailing commas
> after the last key-value pair. You can use [this JSON tool][json lint] to
> validate your JSON if you need to troubleshoot.

With all that in place, click send:

![postman post request](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/testing-apis-with-postman/postman-post-request.png)

Success! The API has received our request and sent back a response representing
a newly created `post`:

```json
{
  "title": "foo",
  "body": "bar",
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 101
}
```

You'll also notice some additional info comes back in the response, such as a
status code of `201 Created` that indicates the successful creation of a
resource.

Experiment with Postman by making requests to other endpoints for the
[JSON Placeholder API][json placeholder]. Try making a PATCH request and a
DELETE request. What changes between these different requests? What does this
API send as a response if you make a bad request?

## Conclusion

API clients like Postman are extremely valuable to have in your API developer
toolkit. They make it simple to interact with servers by giving you full control
over how the response is being sent, with a nice interface for customizing the
HTTP verb, URL, headers, and body.

In future lessons, we'll be expanding our API to handle non-GET requests, so
being able to use a tool like Postman will make our API development much easier!
It's also a great tool to use if you're exploring a third-party API for use in
your projects.
